# ewindow

ewindow is a free software project for for internet audiovisual communication, that can run on a cheap single-board-computer, like a Raspberry Pi

## The Goal

We strongly believe that a free software communication platform is
really needed to protect freedom of speech and e-democracy.
Commercial software which you can use for free is not a gift. Itâ€™s a Trojan horse.
Systems based on proprietary code leave users unprotected and their centralized architectures expose people and  their data.
So, for us is mandatory to have a free and open system and we understood
that it can only be developed by a huge and diversified group of developers.
The goal is not just to have a videochat system for Makerspaces and FabLabs, but to increase the security
and to protect the freedom of all of us.

Building and installation  
==================



Building baresip:

$ git clone https://github.com/creytiv/re
$ git clone https://github.com/creytiv/rem
$ git clone https://github.com/alfredh/baresip

$ cd re && make && sudo make install && cd ..
$ cd rem && make && sudo make install && cd ../baresip

$ make && make install


Configuration
=============

Start baresip once to create config file and  # Test Audio Feedback.
$ ./baresip -e /auloop

Edit ~/.baresip/config to 

$ echo "<sip:DISPLAYNAME:xxx@example.org;regint=0;" >> ~/.baresip/accounts 

Explanation: Add a sip user with any name, password, and domain 


To build ewindow core and the modules we forked from baresip and we are using ( GNU/BSD Make)

tutorials
======

To build ewindow with default options: 
$

$ 

Default templates for configuration files will be created here: $HOME/.baresip  You can now edit the files "config" and "accounts" to customize your installation.
